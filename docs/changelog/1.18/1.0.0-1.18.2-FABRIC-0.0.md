### 1.0.0-1.18.2-FABRIC-0.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Requirements
- **Fabric API:** 0.59.0+1.18.2

#### Overview

AE2CC Bridge adds a simple peripheral block that may be used to access an [Applied Energistics 2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2)
ME system from [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched) computers.

Keep in mind that this mod is slightly unbalanced by design as the peripheral
access to the ME system allows you to circumvent some channel limitations at
practically no energy cost.

> **Note**: Currently, the peripheral only exposes a fairly small API. If you
> find that functionality you need is missing, please file a feature request in
> our issue tracker.
